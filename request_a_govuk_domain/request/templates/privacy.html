        Who we are
      </h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        The Protecting Public Sector Domains Team at the Central Digital and Data Office (CDDO) is responsible for approving all .gov.uk domain names on behalf of the Cabinet Office.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Most public sector organisations must use a .gov.uk or other government domain name for their websites, emails and services.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">The Get approval to use a .gov.uk domain name is a service that lets sector organisations register a .gov.uk domain name.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Approved Registrars who use the the Get approval to use a .gov.uk domain name service are the data controller and Cabinet Office is the data processor. The data controller must tell you about what they are doing with your personal data.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">For more information see the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) <a href="https://ico.org.uk/esdwebpages/search" class="govuk-link">Data Protection Public Register</a>. The Cabinet Office registration number is: Z7414053</p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What data we collect from you
      </h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">The personal data we collect that is part of the .gov.uk domain name approval process includes:
      </p>

        <li>the Approved Registrar's contact name</li>
        <li>the Approved Registrar's phone number</li>
        <li>the Approved Registrar's email address</li>
        <li>the Registrant's organisation name</li>
        <li>the Registrant's contact name</li>
        <li>the Registrant's email address</li>
        <li>the Registrant's phone number</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">The legal basis for processing this data is 'public task' - allowing you to access the Get approval to use a .gov.uk domain name service to register a .gov.uk domain name on behalf of a public sector organisation.
      </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        Why we need your data
      </h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">We need your personal data to ensure that only legitimate users of the Get approval to use a .gov.uk domain name service can use it to register .gov.uk domain names.
      </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        What we do with your data
      </h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">We use your data to check that you are allowed to access the Get approval to use a .gov.uk domain name service and to record your activity when using it. We use third party suppliers to do this.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">We will not:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>sell or rent your data to third parties</li>
        <li>share your data with third parties for marketing purposes</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">We will share your data if we are required to do so by law - for example, by court order, or to prevent fraud or other crime.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        How long we keep your data
      </h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">We'll keep your personal data for as long as you have a .gov.uk domain name registered.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">When you ask us to close your account, we will delete your data within 1 year.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">When we close your account we'll delete your:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>name</li>
        <li>phone number</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">So we can carry out security audits, we'll keep your email address for 1 year before we delete them.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        Where your data is processed and stored
      </h2>

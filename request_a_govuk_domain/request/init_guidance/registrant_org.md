**How to check:**

1. You can use the following sources to help check a registrant organisation exists:
    * [List of Parish Councils](https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/entity/?dataset=parish). If the Parish Council is not on the list you can ask the The Parish Council Domain Helper Service team to see if a council has come through their service and check other trusted sources
    * [Departments, agencies and public bodies](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations)
    * [Metropolitan districts, London boroughs, Unitary authorities, County and District councils ](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6401d6a6d3bf7f25f813fc3a/List_of_councils_in_England_2023.pdf)
    * [Combined Authorities](https://www.local.gov.uk/topics/devolution/devolution-online-hub/devolution-explained/combined-authorities#:~:text=A%20combined%20authority%20(CA)%20is,or%20even%20a%20joint%20committee)
    * For organisations representing a group of Public Sector bodies, seek evidence from trusted internet sources and/or ask wider Domains Team
    * for organisations representing a profession, seek evidence from trusted internet sources and/or ask wider Domains Team
    * For potential new organisations, seek evidence from independent central government or wider public sector sources that this new organisation is being set up

2. Check evidence of any online activity
    * Work that the organisation has done
    * Existing websites they have

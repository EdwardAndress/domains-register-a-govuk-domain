# Initial guidance text

These markdown files are used to populate the table of guidance text when the app is first deployed. If the guidance
needs to be changed in an already running app, change it in the admin site using a superuser account. If you want to
change the guidance for NEW deployments, change it here.

The text in the markdown files will only be inserted if no text exists already.

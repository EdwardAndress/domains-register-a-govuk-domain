**How to check:**

For Parish Council Clerks:

* Check any existing websites that belong to the organisation for the named person and their role as Parish Clerk
* Check the websites of the Principal Authorities that cover the Parish for the named person and their role as Parish Clerk
* Enquire with NALC and/or SLCC to confirm whether they are the recognised Parish Clerk

For all others:

* Check WHOIS records to see whether the Registrant’s email address belongs to the organisation
* Check any existing websites that belong to the organisation for the named person and their role
* For new organisations, check WHOIS records to see whether the Registrant’s email address belongs to an existing organisation that we know is setting up the new organisation
* Any evidence online of the Registrant conducting any activity on behalf of the organisation.

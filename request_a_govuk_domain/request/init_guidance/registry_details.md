**How to check:**

* Check that there are no personal details in these fields. The role should be "Clerk" for parish councils, for example.

* Check the email address is role-based, like itsupport@[yourorganisation].gov.uk. We must not accept individual emails addresses or non-gov.uk email addresses like Gmail, Yahoo. If it is a parish council application the Registrar's email address will be acceptable here
